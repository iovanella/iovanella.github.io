Overview
This file contains the basic setting, the function for the computation of the resilience mu and a launcher which runs the simulations for every values of delta and xi and plot the results. As first step, set as G the current network, then set the values for delta and xi. Within the function mu there are lines of codes for the three gamma and three theta settings.

Please uncomment the lines as your choice.
Please note that the code is not optimized and hopefully without major bug.
Any comments or corrections are really welcome.
